# USDA-FS-SRS-Watershed-77
The USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station manages 
and collects data from the Santee Experimental Forest 
located in the Francis Marion National Forest in South Carolina. 
Watershed 77 is located within the Santee EF and is 
currently being used to study forest treatment
effects on forest production. 
This repository contains scripts written to
combine data, perform calculations, and generate data visualization
of the treatment watershed (ws77) and the reference watershed (ws80). This project was funded and managed by the College of Charleston, SC and the USDA-FS-SRS.
